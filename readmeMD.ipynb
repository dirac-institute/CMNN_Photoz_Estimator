    "# CMNN_Photoz_Estimator\n",
    "A Python3 implementation of the Color-Matched Nearest-Neighbors photometric redshift estimator.<br>\n",
    "Melissa L. Graham, 2020. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Overview of the CMNN Estimator\n",
    "The color-matched nearest-neighbors (CMNN) photometric redshift (photo-_z_) estimator is described thoroughly in Graham et al. (2018, 2020).\n",
    "The CMNN Estimator provides photometric redshifts with an accuracy that is directly dependent on (and only on) the quality of the simulated observed photometry which, as described below, depends directly and only on the $5{\\sigma}$ limiting magnitudes.\n",
    "This makes it an ideal tool for assessing the impact on photo-_z_ results from different proposed LSST observing strategies that build image depth over time in different ways, or result in different coadded depths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulated Test and Training Sets\n",
    "The CMNN Estimator uses a _training set_ with known (i.e., spectroscopic) redshifts to estimate photometric redshifts for a _test set_ of galaxies.\n",
    "In order to simulate a test and training set of galaxies with photometry that represents any desired LSST observing strategy, we start with the same mock galaxy catalog as in Graham et al. (2018, 2020).\n",
    "As in those works, the observed apparent magnitudes and errors for filters _ugrizy_ for all galaxies are simulated based on the true catalog apparent magnitudes and the predicted $5{\\sigma}$ limiting magnitude depths for any given LSST observing strategy.\n",
    "The photometric error, $\\sigma_{\\rm rand}$, is given in Section 3.2.1 of Ivezić et al. (2019): $\\sigma^2_{\\rm rand} = (0.04-\\gamma)x + \\gamma x^2$, where $x=10^{0.4(m-m_5)}$, $m_5$ is the $5\\sigma$ limiting magnitude, $m$ is the magnitude of the galaxy, and for the LSST optical filters the values for $\\gamma$, which sets the impact of, e.g., sky brightness, are $0.037$, $0.038$, $0.039$, $0.039$, $0.04$, and $0.04$ for filters _ugrizy_, respectively.\n",
    "A random value drawn from a normal distribution with a standard deviation equal to the photometric error for each galaxy is added to the true catalog magnitude to generate observed apparent magnitudes.\n",
    "For example, the photometric error of a galaxy with a true catalog magnitude of $i=24.5$ mag would be $\\sigma_{\\rm rand} = 0.026$; a random normal draw of $0.054$ would lead to an observed apparent magnitude of $i=24.55$ mag.\n",
    "Observed apparent colors are calculated from the observed apparent magnitudes, and the error in the color is the photometric errors added in quadrature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Estimating Photometric Redshifts\n",
    "For each galaxy in the test set, the estimator identifies a color-matched subset of training galaxies by calculating the Mahalanobis distance in color-space between the test galaxy and all training galaxies:<br>\n",
    "$D_M = \\sum_{\\rm 1}^{N_{\\rm colors}} \\frac{( c_{\\rm train} - c_{\\rm test} )^2}{ (\\delta c_{\\rm test})^2}$<br>\n",
    "where $c$ is the color of the test- or training-set galaxy, $\\delta c_{\\rm test}$ is the uncertainty in the test galaxy's color, and $N_{\\rm color}$ is the number of colors measured for both the test- and training-set galaxy. \n",
    "A threshold value is then applied to all training-set galaxies to identify those which are well-matched in color, as defined by the percent point function (PPF): e.g., if the number of degrees of freedom $N_{\\rm color}=5$, PPF$=68\\%$ of all training galaxies consistent with the test galaxy will have $D_M < 5.86$.\n",
    "A training galaxy is then selected by one of three modes from this subset of color-matched nearest-neighbors, and its redshift is used as the test-set galaxy's photometric redshift.\n",
    "The three modes of selection are to choose randomly, to choose the galaxy with the lowest $D_M$, or to weight the random selection by the inverse of the $D_M$.\n",
    "The standard deviation in redshifts of this subset of training galaxies is used as the uncertainty in the photo-_z_ estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis with Statistical Measures\n",
    "This implementation of the CMNN Estimator will make two types of plots to evaluate the quality of the test set's photometric redshifts: (1) true redshift vs. photometric redshift, and (2) statistical measures of the standard deviation, bias, and fraction of outliers in the photo-_z_ accuracy ($\\Delta z = (|z_{\\rm true} - z_{\\rm phot}|)/(1+z_{\\rm phot})$) as a function of photo-_z_.\n",
    "Details of how these statistics are calculated are provided in Graham et al. (2018, 2020), and additional statistics that are calculated but not automatically plotted are listed in \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Capabilitites and Boundaries\n",
    "This repository allows the user to specify $5{\\sigma}$ limiting magnitude depths for the 6 Rubin Observatory filters _ugrizy_, sizes and magnitude cut-offs of the test and training sets, and parameters for the CMNN Estimator.\n",
    "The codes will generate test and training sets with appropriate simulated apparent magnitudes and errors, estimate photometric redshifts for test set galaxies, and perform a statistical analysis which generates diagnostic plots.\n",
    "All of these steps are described in Section 2 of Graham et al. (2020).\n",
    "The codes in this repository are designed to do all of these steps automatically for a single set of user input (a single \"run\") from one command-line call to cmnn\\_run.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "The galaxy catalog \"LSST\\_galaxy\\_catalog\\_i25p3.dat\" (contact author; it's $>100$ MB) is equivalent to the mock catalog used by Graham et al. (2018,2020), but limited to galaxies with true apparent magnitudes $i\\leq25.3$ mag.\n",
    "Furthermore, the test and training sets may not include galaxies with simulated observed magnitudes $i>25$ mag.\n",
    "This matches the $i\\leq25$ mag \"gold sample\" defined by the Science Requirement Document (ls.st/lpm-17), and matches many of the photo-$z$ simulations in Graham et al. (2018,2020).\n",
    "For access to a deeper catalog contact the author (some hard-coded changes to cmnn\\_catalog.py will be required).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the statistical results of multiple runs can be done with optional configurations of the make\\_stats\\_plots module in cmnn\\_analysis.py, but this is not automatic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The codes in this repository rely on the following packages: os, datetime, matplotlib, numpy, and scipy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples: Photo-z results for a given year of the baseline observing strategy.\n",
